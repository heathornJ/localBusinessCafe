      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
        The Local Business Cafe is our pride and joy. The idea came about during
        an internship, where I'd run off and get the coffees for everyone.
        That's about all I did. So I thought "Why not get paid for these coffee
        runs?" I built the Local Business Cafe to be a great workspace for busy
        individuals. Strong coffee, tasty food, and WiFi strong enough for any
        business meeting!
