        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
          The Local Business Cafe is our pride and joy. The idea came about
          during an internship, where I'd run off and get the coffees for
          everyone. That's about all I did. So I thought "Why not get paid for
          these coffee runs?" I built the Local Business Cafe to be a great
          workspace for busy individuals. Strong coffee, tasty food, and WiFi
          strong enough for any business meeting!
