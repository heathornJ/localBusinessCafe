          <h1>About Us</h1>
          <p>
            The Local Business Cafe is our pride and joy. The idea came about
            during an internship, where I'd run off and get the coffees for
            everyone. That's about all I did. So I thought "Why not get paid for
            these coffee runs?" I built the Local Business Cafe to be a great
            workspace for busy individuals. Strong coffee, tasty food, and WiFi
            strong enough for any business meeting!
