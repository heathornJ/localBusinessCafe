            <h2>Our Business</h2>
            <p>
              The Local Business Cafe is our pride and joy. The idea came about
            during an internship, where I'd run off and get the coffees for
            everyone. That's about all I did. So I thought "Why not get paid for
            these coffee runs?" I built the Local Business Cafe to be a great
            workspace for busy individuals. Strong coffee, tasty food, and WiFi
            strong enough for any business meeting!

            <h2>Our Coffee</h2>
            <p>
              Tech has a massive impact on our local and global wildlife. The same can be said for coffee. It's estimated that one cup of coffee destroys roughly one square inch of rainforest, making it a leading cause of rainforest destruction. That's why all of our blends are Rainforest Alliance Certified.

              Caffeine isn't the only ingredient to a successful day of database management and business reports. We prepare both our meals and snacks fresh daily using locally sourced ingredients or have some of those local business prep for us themselves. By supporting us, you support the community too!
