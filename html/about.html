              <p>
                The Local Business Café is our pride and joy. The idea came
                about during an internship, where I'd run off and get the
                coffees for everyone. That's about all I did. So I thought "Why
                not get paid for these coffee runs?" I built the Local Business
                Café to be a great workspace for busy individuals. Strong
                coffee, tasty food, and WiFi strong enough for any business
                meeting!

                Tech has a massive impact on our local and global wildlife. The
                same can be said for coffee. It's estimated that one cup of
                coffee destroys roughly one square inch of rainforest, making it
                a leading cause of rainforest destruction. That's why all of our
                blends are Rainforest Alliance Certified.

                Caffeine isn't the only ingredient to a successful day of
                database management and business reports. We prepare both our
                meals and snacks fresh daily using locally sourced ingredients
                or have some of those local business prep for us themselves. By
                supporting us, you support the community too!
