- The HTML files have passed HTML validity checks with W3C, but had some warnings about sections or articles without headings and info pointers about trailing slashes on self-closing tags. Sections or articles where it did not make sense to have a heading were turned into divs, trailing slashes will be removed before final commit as these are added by default with the formatter that is currently being used.
